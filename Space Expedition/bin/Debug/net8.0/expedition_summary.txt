NESULANBODLENEC, Asterion-X2, Galactic Cycle A6-010, Sector D-20 - Unit 11, An elaborate network of fine silver filaments continuously shifts and flows into new configurations. When activated the net seems to mimic the constellations of the night sky possibly used for celestial navigation or as a star map. The delicate strands appear fragile yet are impervious to any physical force hinting at advanced alien technology.

Believed to have been used for studying astral phenomena or for interstellar navigation. The frames adjust to fit any wearer suggesting a highly adaptive design.
WORMHOLEWOBBLEWAND, Galaxara-IX, Galactic Cycle 4X-142, Sector H-21 - Unit 7, A slender wand that vibrates subtly in the presence of spatial anomalies. Tests have shown it can slightly alter local spacetime fabric; handle with care. Its origin remains a mystery fueling speculations about its use in wormhole creation or manipulation.
